          I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of note-taking applications. Ive used Google
          Keep, <a href="https://standardnotes.com/">Standard Notes</a>,
          <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a>, and more recently,
          <a href="https://github.com/Dullage/flatnotes">Flatnotes</a>. All of
          these options (minus Google Keep) have a few common traits. They are
          all self-hostable, open-source, and support markdown. Going forward,
          any note-taking application I use must have these three key features.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed Flatnotes. It has one key feature that made
          me move away from Joplin which is plain markdown file storage. Unlike
          Joplin which stores note data in an SQL database, Flatnotes reads and
          writes data directly to markdown files stored on the server. This
          makes it incredibly easy to move notes in and out of the server and
          very easy to back up notes by keeping them in a Docker volume. Nothing
          is locking your notes into the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flatnotes is not without its flaws though. I&rsquo;m not a fan of the
          list view as it does not make efficient use of the users&rsquo;
          vertical screen real estate. The home screen - it&rsquo;s just a
          search bar, with no list view of your notes. I tend to use my notes
          more for long-term storage / archival purposes, so while the search
          function is nice, it&rsquo;s not a super valuable feature for my use
          case.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/images/papernote/flatnotes-screenshots.png"
            alt="flatnotes"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          So I decided to build my own note-taking application, taking into
          consideration how I write my notes and building on the features that I
          loved about Flatnotes. I could have just forked it and built a new
          front end, but where&rsquo;s the fun in that? I decided to build my
          app from the ground up using Golang on the backend and HTMX on the
          front end. This turned out to be a fantastic choice, not just because
          the tools are cool and powerful, but also as a learning opportunity.
        </p>
        <h2 id="learning-web-development-history">
          Learning Web Development History
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have very little web development experience. I&rsquo;ve built a few
          apps in React and Vue.js, but that&rsquo;s about it. What I did not
          know before starting this project was how little I knew about web
          development. Until I began to learn how to use HTMX, I essentially
          thought everything on the web was built using enormous Javascript
          frameworks like React, Angular, or something else of the like.
          &ldquo;Single Page Applications&rdquo; (SPA&rsquo;s) was all I knew.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning HTMX required that I also learn about the history of web
          development and how far modern web apps have strayed from the original
          vision of REST. I won&rsquo;t dive too deep into the mission of HTMX
          in this article, but I highly recommend reading Chapter 1 from
          <a href="https://hypermedia.systems/hypermedia-reintroduction/"
            >Hypermedia Systems</a
          >, the free user manual for HTMX, for a deeper explanation. In a
          nutshell: Most modern web apps make heavy use of enormous client-side
          Javascript frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue. In this model,
          the client-server interaction is reduced merely to exchanging JSON
          information. The server manages all the data while the client does all
          the front-end legwork. HTMX harkens back to simpler days of web
          development by leaning into server-side rendering for dynamic
          application behavior. The server is responsible both for data
          management and controlling the front-end state. Some may argue that
          this approach is less flexible, but it has the benefit of reduced
          client-side complexity and an overall simpler application
          architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose Golang for the backend because it supports all the tooling I
          need and seems to pair well with HTMX. (Also I just wanted to learn
          Go.) A cool side effect of using HTMX is that you can pretty much use
          whatever language you want in the backend, as long as it has support
          for building an HTTP server and HTML templating. Flatnotes, for
          example, is built in Python.
        </p>
        <h2 id="papernote">Papernote</h2>
        <p>
          With that, I would like to introduce
          <a href="https://github.com/noahhefner/papernote">Papernote</a> - a
          self-hostable, markdown-driven, (almost) database-less note-taking web
          application, built on HTMX and Golang. It is very basic, but I think
          it&rsquo;s at a good MVP state at this point. The markdown editor
          especially lacks a lot of features that other note apps have, such as
          a &ldquo;ribbon&rdquo; for inserting things like tables, bold text,
          italics, images, etc. But this was an intentional choice as I wanted
          to have as few dependencies as possible. There are libraries out there
          for editing markdown, but I wasn&rsquo;t stoked about any existing
          options. I skipped using any CSS libraries as well. The only
          dependencies are HTMX and a markdown rendering library called
          <a href="https://github.com/markedjs/marked">Marked</a>.
        </p>

          <img
            src="/images/papernote/fullscreen-view.png"
            alt="fullscreen-view"
          />
        </p>
        <h2 id="features-and-architecture">Features and Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          One feature that I&rsquo;m very excited about is note previews. On the
          main notes page, you&rsquo;re presented with a list of your notes on
          the left and a preview pane on the right. Hovering over a note title
          will trigger a request to the server to fetch the contents of that
          note. The note contents are returned to the client where HTMX will
          swap them into the preview pane. Marked will then pick up those
          contents and perform the markdown to HTML rendering client-side.
          Additionally, quick-action buttons will be added next to the note
          being previewed. You can choose to delete, open in fullscreen view, or
          edit the note, right there next to the note name. (These options are
          visible in the first screenshot above.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The editor view is very simple - markdown on the left, HTML on the
          right. I hope to build more functionality into the editor in the
          future (like image support). But this will do for now. The rendering
          is again handled here on the client side. I wanted the rendering to be
          real-time and to update on every keystroke from the user, so
          client-side rendering was the appropriate choice here. Otherwise, the
          client would need to send a request to the server on every keystroke
          and get back a rendered page, which is for obvious reasons,
          ridiculous.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a full-page note view. This is great if you only need to
          see one of your notes as a reference for something else you are
          working on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple users are also supported. User management is handled by an
          SQLite database file (thus the &ldquo;almost&rdquo; in my earlier
          statement, &ldquo;(almost) database-less&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s dead
          simple, storing usernames and hashed passwords. Authentication is
          implemented as a standard middleware, utilizing JSON web tokens. Each
          user gets their own directory on the server and their notes are stored
          in that folder as plain markdown files. (This was the killer feature
          of Flatnotes that I stole for this project).

          And that&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s my new notes app. The project can be
          found on my Github page. I&rsquo;m open to taking pull requests from
          anyone who wants to contribute. I&rsquo;m thrilled at the state of it
          now and I am planning to fully swap over from Flatnotes sometime in
          the near future (need to iron out a few more UI things first). I have
          learned so much about web development in building this project and
          HTMX has been a huge reason why. I am already applying principals
          learned from this project in my professional work too, which is always
          great.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
